\title{Mt Fyffe example dataset for Veg-X}
\description{
Forest data from five permanent plots from the east coast of South Island
(New Zealand). The data comprises i) site information from each plot; ii)
cover scores of taxa within height strata; iii) dbh measurement of individual
trees within subplots that fully partition the permanent plot; iv) counts of
saplings within subplots that fully partition the permanent plot; and v)
counts of seedlings within height strata within subplots that sample the
permanent plot. Two full measurements of the permanent plots are provided.
The data set includes six data frames:
