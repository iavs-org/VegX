\title{Merge Veg-X documents}
\usage{
mergeVegX(x, y, mergeIdentities = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{The objects of class \code{\linkS4class{VegX}} to be merged.}

\item{mergeIdentities}{A flag used to force that organism identities should be merged when sharing the same organismName.}

\item{verbose}{A flag to indicate console output of the data integration process.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\linkS4class{VegX}} with the pooled data
}
\description{
Merges two Veg-X documents while considering that some of their entities may be shared.
}
\details{
Some entities are attempted to be merged or are kept as separate entities depeding on their definition:
\itemize{
  \item \code{projects} are merged when their element \code{title} has the same value.
  \item \code{plots} are merged when their element \code{plotName} has the same value.
  \item \code{plotObservations} are merged when both their \code{plotID} and \code{obsStartDate} elements have the same value
  \item \code{organismIdentities} are merged if they share the same organismName and \code{mergeIdentities = TRUE} because
  one can have the same name used in different data sets but referring to different concepts.
  \item \code{methods} are merged when their element \code{name} has the same value.
  \item \code{strata} are merged when their element \code{stratumName} has the same value.
  \item \code{stratumObservations} are merged when both their \code{stratumID} and \code{plotObservationID} elements have the same value
  \item \code{aggregateOrganismObservations} are merged when their \code{plotObservationID} and \code{organismIdentityID} (and \code{stratumObservationID}, if defined) have the same value
  \item \code{individualOrganisms} are merged when both their \code{plotID} and \code{individualOrganismLabel} have the same value
  \item \code{individualOrganismObservations} are merged when both their \code{plotObservationID} and \code{individualOrganismID} have the same value.
  \item \code{surfaceTypes} are merged when their element \code{surfaceName} has the same value
  \item \code{surfaceCoverObservations} are merged when both their \code{surfaceTypeID} and \code{plotObservationID} elements have the same value
  \item \code{siteObservations} are merged into the same element when their element \code{plotObservationID} has the same value, but particular measurements are always added
  as if they were distinct pieces of information.
}
Merging to these entities may cause interruption of the process if the two entities to be merged
have different value for the same element. Other entities (e.g., \code{attributes} of a method) are always considered as distinct
entities between the two data sets to be merged and hence are simply copied to the result.
