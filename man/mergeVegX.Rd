\title{Merge Veg-X documents}
\usage{
mergeVegX(x, y, allowMergePlots = FALSE,
  allowMergeOrganismIdentities = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{The objects of class \code{\linkS4class{VegX}} to be merged.}

\item{allowMergePlots}{If \code{TRUE} plots should be merged when sharing the same plotName and, if defined, plotUniqueIdentifier. 
If \code{FALSE} plots are never merged (i.e. the two VegX documents are considered as coming from different vegetation data sources).}

\item{allowMergeOrganismIdentities}{If \code{TRUE}, allows organism identities sharing the same organismName to be merged. 
If \code{FALSE} organism identities are never merged (i.e. the two VegX documents are considered as coming from different vegetation data sources).}

\item{verbose}{A flag to indicate console output of the data integration process.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\linkS4class{VegX}} with the pooled data
}
\description{
Merges two Veg-X documents while considering that some of their entities may be shared.
}
\details{
Some entities are attempted to be merged or are kept as separate entities depeding on their definition:
\itemize{
  \item \code{projects} are merged when their element \code{title} has the same value.
  \item \code{plots} are merged, if \code{allowMergePlots = TRUE}, when they have the same value for element \code{plotName} and, if defined, 
  \code{plotUniqueIdentifier} are also equal.
  \item \code{plotObservations} are merged when both their \code{plotID} and \code{obsStartDate} elements have the same value
  \item \code{organismIdentities} are merged if they share the same organismName and \code{allowMergeOrganismIdentities = TRUE} because
  one can have the same name used in different data sets but referring to different concepts.
  \item \code{methods} are merged when their element \code{name} has the same value.
  \item \code{strata} are merged when their element \code{stratumName} has the same value and the corresponding method has the same \code{name}.
  \item \code{stratumObservations} are merged when both their \code{stratumID} and \code{plotObservationID} elements have the same value.
  \item \code{aggregateOrganismObservations} are merged when their \code{plotObservationID} and \code{organismIdentityID} (and \code{stratumObservationID}, if defined) have the same value
  \item \code{individualOrganisms} are merged when both their \code{plotID} and \code{individualOrganismLabel} have the same value.
  \item \code{individualOrganismObservations} are merged when both their \code{plotObservationID} and \code{individualOrganismID} have the same value.
  \item \code{surfaceTypes} are merged when their element \code{surfaceName} has the same value and the corresponding method has the same \code{name}.
  \item \code{surfaceCoverObservations} are merged when both their \code{surfaceTypeID} and \code{plotObservationID} elements have the same value
  \item \code{siteObservations} are merged into the same element when their element \code{plotObservationID} has the same value, but particular measurements are always added
  as if they were distinct pieces of information.
}
Merging to these entities may cause interruption of the process if the two entities to be merged
have different value for the same element. Other entities (e.g., \code{attributes} of a method) are always considered as distinct
entities between the two data sets to be merged and hence are simply copied to the result.
